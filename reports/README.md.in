## Ontology import closure

CASE-Corpora imports multiple ontologies and other RDF schemata developed outside of the Cyber Domain Ontology.  The following illustration (click to see navigable SVG) shows how the various ontologies (/schemata) are imported.

The root of the imports is the CASE-Corpora knowledge base, which imports a shapes graph.  The imports then onward generally follow the pattern of shape graphs importing ontology (/schemata) graphs.
