# Dataset entry request
<!--
If you do not feel ready to write the dataset description in CASE and DCAT, the maintainers may be able to assist.  However, they will need to know the following details:
-->

* *Access level* ([definition](https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/#accessLevel)): <!--If this can't be listed as "public", CASE-Corpora will index this dataset, but is likely to provide significantly less detail.-->
* *Human subjects data* ([practices](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Corpora/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md#references-of-real-people)): Please check one of the following boxes.
   - [ ] For each real person that appears in this dataset, I attest that I have permission and appropriate consent to share the person's data when this dataset may contain human subject data.
   - [ ] I do not believe this dataset contains human subject data.
* *Landing page* ([definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:resource_landing_page)): <!--This should be a URL-->
* *Distribution download URL(s)* ([definition](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Property:distribution_download_url)):
   - [ ] https://example.org/distribution-url-1
   - [ ] https://example.org/distribution-url-2
   - <!--Please provide at least one of the dataset's resources that can be downloaded presently.  You do not need to list all of the downloadable resources, but please do list at least one that you think makes this dataset worth indexing by itself.-->
   - [ ] (alt.) https://mirror.example.net/distribution-url-3, SHA2-256 `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`
   - <!--If the URL is a mirror of the original, please note "(alt.)" before the URL.-->


## Motivation for adding to CASE-Corpora
<!--
This section is optional, but among the most helpful to the CASE community if you are able to elaborate with even a sentence.  What is something you think is valuable about this dataset?  Does it characterize data within a certain class of device?  Does it include a demonstrable link between two objects?  Is there a certain application that is characterized?  Is it a complex scenario hitting on multiple of the above points?

For example: "Among other features, this dataset features artifacts derived from an Internet of Things network."
