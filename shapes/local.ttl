	sh:description """This (no-op) shape serves as an anchor for describing that rdf:Statements are disallowed in CASE-Corpora due to a believed incompatibility with OWL 2 DL.  The belief stems in the property definition of rdf:object, as well as a scope of definition responsibility.

First, assuming authority to cast the property into OWL, that property cannot be either an owl:ObjectProperty or owl:DatatypeProperty, due to being general enough to support Identified Nodes (IRIs and BNodes) and Literals.  An AnnotationProperty would be most appropriate.  But then, for symmetry, rdf:subject and rdf:predicate should also be an AnnotationProperty.  This leaves the inferential value of rdf:Statement in question - neither a Statement, nor any subclass (for example, some ex:ContradictionStatement), could apply reasoning across the rdf: properties.

Second, if casting authority is not assumed, for maximal compatibility it would be the responsibility of the OWL specification to interpret the property types of rdf:object et al.  Otherwise, use of a base RDF property would become an OWL-level incompatibility if two knowledge bases were merged with different OWL property type assignments.

For all these reasons, CASE-Corpora disallows rdf:Statement."""@en ;
